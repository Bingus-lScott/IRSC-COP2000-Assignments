⦁	Data Tracing Chart (1pt): a table used to track the values of variables during a desk check.
⦁	Test Softcopy (.5 pt): a simulation of the screen's appearance during a desk check.

Problem Statement: 
Ask the user for the number of seats purchased for each of the following types of seating: Balcony, Grand Tier, Loge, Mezzanine, and Orchestra; and then record each value 
inputed into it's own respective variable. After assigning values to the seating variables, initalize new variables for totals. I will state each respective type of seating's
pricing: 
Balcony - $50
Grand Tier - $175.25
Loge - $125
Mezzanine - $100
Orchestra - $230.50
Multiply the number of seats sold by the pricing and assign that value to a total value for each of the stated categories of seating.
Then, display a name for the theatre (of your choice) and seperate the title with a line of dashes/hyphens the same length the title reaches. 
Below the line break, each in a seperate line, state the type of seating immediately followed by a colon, 1-2 tabs (for equal whitespace), and the total price of all tickets sold in that
category each in a new line.
(example:
Balcony:		$5000
Grand Tier:		$50,000)
Following the sublimation of each respective totals, caclulate a grand title and format it the same as the previous totals but title it "Total Sales:".
